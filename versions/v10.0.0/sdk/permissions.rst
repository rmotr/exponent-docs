Permissions
***********

When it comes to adding functionality that can access potentially sensitive
information on a user's device, such as their location, or possibly send them
possibly unwanted push notifications, you will need to ask the user for their
permission first. Unless you've already asked their permission, then no need.
And so we have the ``Permissions`` module.

.. function:: Exponent.Permissions.getAsync(type)

   Determines whether your app has already been granted access to the provided
   permission type.

   :param string type:
      The name of the permission.

   :returns:
      Returns a ``Promise`` that is resolved with the information about the
      permission, including status, expiration and scope (if it applies to
      the permission type).


   :example:
      .. code-block:: javascript

        async function alertIfRemoteNotificationsDisabledAsync() {
          const { Permissions } = Exponent;
          const { status } = await Permissions.getAsync(Permissions.REMOTE_NOTIFICATIONS);

          if (status !== 'granted') {
            alert('Hey! You might want to enable notifications for my app, they are good.');
          }
        }

.. function:: Exponent.Permissions.askAsync(type)

   Prompt the user for a permission. If they have already granted access,
   response will be success.

   :param string type:
      The name of the permission.

   :returns:
      Returns a ``Promise`` that is resolved with the information about the
      permission, including status, expiration and scope (if it applies to
      the permission type).

   :example:
      .. code-block:: javascript

        async function getLocationAsync() {
          const { Location, Permissions } = Exponent;
          const { status } = await Permissions.askAsync(Permissions.LOCATION);

          if (status === 'granted') {
            return Location.getCurrentPositionAsync({enableHighAccuracy: true});
          } else {
            throw new Error('Location permission not granted');
          }
        }

.. attribute:: Exponent.Permissions.REMOTE_NOTIFICATIONS

   The permission type for push notifications.

.. attribute:: Exponent.Permissions.LOCATION

   The permission type for location access.

.. attribute:: Exponent.Permissions.CAMERA

   The permission type for camera access.
